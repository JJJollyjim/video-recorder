# Video Recorder

> By Jamie McClymont <jamie.mcclymont@gmail.com>

Records video from the webcam directly to Google Drive.

Works in Chrome (incl. Chromebooks), and Firefox on a good day.

The video uploads while the user is recording, so little time is spent waiting for an upload to complete once the recording is complete.
